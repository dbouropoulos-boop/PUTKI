# PUTKI HQ — Operator's Runbook

One-page playbook for running the funnel from `/back-office/bot-routing`.
Read this once. Refer to the **Cookbook** when something looks off.

## 0 · Where to log in

- **Dashboard**: `https://putkihq.fi/back-office/bot-routing` (or the active preview URL)
- **30-day history**: `https://putkihq.fi/back-office/funnel`
- **Admin token**: see `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`. The page remembers it in `localStorage` after the first unlock.

## 1 · The daily ritual (5 minutes)

Each morning around **09:30 EET** (30 min after the daily cron):

| Check                       | Where                                                 | What "healthy" looks like                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subscriber growth           | Top strip — TOTAL SUBS vs. yesterday's screenshot     | Trending up week-over-week                                 |
| Today's dispatch fired      | Funnel snapshot → **DM SENT** cell                    | `> 0` (or `+N DRY-RUN` if `daily_dm_enabled` is still off) |
| Mini App engagement         | Funnel snapshot → **MINI APP OPEN** ≥ ~30% of DM SENT | Click the cell → distinct `tg:` rows                       |
| Router producing real picks | Router activity → CLICKS table                        | Status mostly `ok` in routed mode, `informative_mode` else |
| 30-day trend                | "30D HISTORY →" link                                  | Trailing 7d end-to-end rate flat or climbing               |

If anything looks off → jump to the **Cookbook (§4)**.

## 2 · The 4 master switches

All live in the **Bot config** section. One PUT per click, no deploy needed.

### 2.1 Flip informative → routed (monetisation ON)

Prereqs:

1. At least **one partner row** in the Affiliate partners table with `status=LIVE`.
2. That partner's `target_geos` must cover the geos you expect (use `FI` for a Finland-only beta).
3. Smoke-test first: hit **MINT LINK** on the dashboard, click "OPEN IN NEW TAB" — you should land on the partner URL (not `/mittari`).

Then flip:

- `signal_unlock_mode` → **ROUTED**
- (Optional) `require_verified_signup` → **STRICT** (default; keeps `/start` gated to the website signup flow)

The Mini App immediately starts showing "Open partner →" on locked cards. The router stops 302-ing to `/mittari` and starts handing traffic to the partner.

### 2.2 Rollback (kill switch)

One click: `signal_unlock_mode` → **INFORMATIVE**.

Effects (all instant, no deploy):
- All `/api/r/{code}` requests 302 to `/mittari` regardless of code or geo.
- Mini App unlock CTAs flip back to "Reveal in-app".
- Click history is preserved in `redirect_click_log` for the post-mortem.

### 2.3 Turn on daily DM dispatch

- `daily_dm_enabled` → **ON**

The next dispatch-window tick at **09:00 EET** will fire `fanout_daily_dms` live for every `mittari_subscriber` with `status=active` + bound chat_id. Each DM is segment-filtered and idempotent per UTC date.

To smoke-test before flipping live:

- `POST /api/admin/bot/dispatch/preview` (always dry-run, no lock side effects)

### 2.4 Adjust the broadcast floor

`sharpness_min` (default 70) gates which picks ride the channel broadcast + the per-subscriber DMs. Raise it to send fewer/sharper, lower for higher volume.

## 3 · Partner management

### 3.1 Add a partner

In the Affiliate partners section, fill the inline row:

| Field                | Example                                  | Notes                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `partner_key`        | `winz-fi`                                | Lowercase slug, no spaces. Becomes a stable URL ID |
| `display_name`       | `Winz Finland`                           | Internal label                                     |
| `affiliate_base_url` | `https://aff.winz.fi/?c={code}&s={subid}` | `{code}` and `{subid}` get substituted at click   |
| `target_geos`        | `FI,EE`                                  | CSV of ISO-2 codes. Empty = global                 |
| `priority_weight`    | `50`                                     | Higher wins ties for the same geo                  |

Save → row appears in the table with `status=LIVE` immediately.

### 3.2 Pause a partner without losing history

Click **PAUSE** on the row. The router skips them but every prior click + conversion stays queryable.

### 3.3 Delete

Click **DEL**. Idempotent — safe to retry. Does not delete historical `redirect_click_log` rows.

## 4 · Cookbook (if you see X, check Y)

### "No signups landing in the last 24h"

1. Bot config → confirm `require_verified_signup` matches the source (STRICT means `/signup` is the only legitimate entry).
2. Open `/signup` directly → confirm the form submits + returns a `pending_id`.
3. Drill into **SIGNUP** cell → look at `accept_language` distribution; if EVERY row is `?` or blank, traffic might be coming from a bot.

### "Signups happen but BOUND stays at 0"

The Telegram deep link isn't binding. Likely culprits:

1. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is empty in `/app/backend/.env` → the bot stops processing `/start`.
2. Telegram webhook URL is stale → check `/back-office/telegram` → "Webhook · bound chats · audit log".
3. `require_verified_signup=STRICT` AND someone is testing with a synthetic pending_id → expected; use `/signup` to mint a real one first.

### "DM SENT shows 0 + N DRY-RUN every day"

`daily_dm_enabled` is OFF. The cron is firing in dry-run mode (safe, no lock written). Flip §2.3 when ready.

### "Mini App opens are flat"

Drill into the **MINI APP OPEN** cell. If you see DMs going out but no opens:

1. Are recipients on iOS Telegram < v8.x? Mini Apps require modern clients.
2. The DM CTA URL may be wrong — env `TELEGRAM_TMA_APP_NAME` must match the @BotFather "newapp" short name. If unset, falls back to the `/tma?pid=` web URL (still works, just less native).

### "Router clicks show `no_partner_for_geo` for every row"

Open the partners table. Either:

- No LIVE partner has `target_geos` covering the click geo (CF-IPCountry header reports), OR
- All LIVE partners are paused.

Add a partner with `target_geos=FI` (or empty for global) → recheck.

### "Conversions show `verified: ✗`"

The partner is sending postbacks but the secret doesn't match. Open `/api/admin/partners` row for that partner → set `postback_secret` to the value the partner is sending (`X-Postback-Secret` header / `secret` field / `?secret=` query — first match wins). Existing unverified rows are kept for reconciliation.

### "30D end-to-end rate trending DOWN"

Open the daily-volume bars on `/back-office/funnel`. The shortest bar in the stack is your bottleneck:

- Short **signup**: marketing / SEO problem, not platform.
- Short **bound**: deep link UX issue or bot is rate-limited (Telegram caps bots at ~30 msgs/sec).
- Short **dm_sent**: probably `daily_dm_enabled` off, or zero-pick days.
- Short **tma_open**: clients on stale Telegram versions, or DM copy needs work.
- Short **unlock_click**: card design / locked-CTA copy issue.

## 5 · External dependencies (still pending)

| Service            | Status              | What you need to do                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YouTube Data API   | quota exceeded      | Bump GCP quota in console or rotate `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in `/app/backend/.env` |
| Resend (email)     | MOCKED              | Verify a domain at resend.com → drop `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM` in `.env` |
| BotFather Mini App | not registered      | `/newapp` on @BotFather → point at the deployed `/tma` URL → set `TELEGRAM_TMA_APP_NAME` |

None of these block the funnel from operating — they each unlock one specific surface (YouTube tile, email channel, native-feel Mini App).

## 7 · Lessons learned (field-tested)

> **Empty by design.** This section is for *real* gotchas the team encounters in production — not predictions. When something surprises you in ops, append a 3-line entry below in this format so the next operator doesn't relearn it the hard way:
>
> ```
> ### YYYY-MM-DD · One-line summary
> **Symptom:** what you saw on the dashboard / in logs.
> **Root cause:** the actual underlying issue (not the first guess).
> **Fix:** the specific action that resolved it (with file paths / endpoints / config values).
> ```
>
> Keep entries in reverse-chronological order (newest at top). Tag entries with `routing`, `dispatch`, `mini-app`, `signup`, or `partner` so future readers can skim by category.

<!-- TODO: review this section after 1-2 weeks of real ops use (target: 2026-06-10). -->

*(No entries yet — the runbook is brand new. The first real-world gotcha goes here.)*
